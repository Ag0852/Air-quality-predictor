Air Quality Predictor
An AI-powered tool to forecast PM2.5 air pollution levels using historical air quality and weather data.

Project Goal
To help communities and individuals anticipate harmful air conditions with next-day pollution forecasts.

Tech Stack
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**
- Developed in **Google Colab**
- Optional: Frontend with **Gradio** or **Streamlit**

Data Sources
- EPA Air Quality System (AQS): PM2.5 data
- NOAA Weather Data (or OpenWeatherMap API)

What It Does
- Cleans and merges pollution + weather data
- Builds a PM2.5 prediction model using machine learning
- Visualizes actual vs predicted values
- Can be deployed as a lightweight app

Why It Matters
Air pollution kills over 7 million people a year. This project demonstrates how AI can democratize access to air quality forecasting and empower communities to take early action.

Future Features
- Location-based forecasting (by ZIP or GPS)
- GPT integration for health guidance
- Global datasets for use in developing countries
